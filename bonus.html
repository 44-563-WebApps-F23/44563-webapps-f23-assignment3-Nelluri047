            A nuclear engineer is a specialized professional who works with nuclear energy and radiation. 
            They are responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining systems and processes that 
            harness nuclear energy for various applications, including power generation, medical imaging, 
            and nuclear weapons. These engineers must ensure safety protocols, handle radioactive materials, 
            and optimize reactor performance. They play a vital role in addressing energy needs, advancing medical 
            technology, and maintaining national security through their expertise in nuclear science and engineering.
